 
  NAME  
         dbci.rb - creates sqlite database, and inserts record from text files
 
  SYNOPSIS
         dbci.rb <full_path_of_sqlite_db> -table:{<table_name_in_db>=<full_path_of_textfile>,*args} [-int:{<column_name>,*args} [-append:<boolean>]]
         
        
  DESCRIPTION
         There are times calculating deep logical data with awk(sed, joins) is 
         much time consuming or later some aspects of them gradually 
         becomes maintainence nightmare. What if we could write custom SQL
         commands, and execute them over those plain text files?
 
         In some case, writing SQL is much more easier and quicker. This little
         tool helps CGI programmers to import plain text file into sqlite database
         as a structured table. Means, it enables a programmer to concentrate on the
         the program logic rather than typing & asserting various IO operations.
 
         First row of the text file will be considered as column names.
         Every column in each row must have some data(not space).
         Plain file example below:
 
         Line.No | employee file data
         -----------------------------
            001. | id name sex age
            002. | AA Battur male 26
            003. | BB George male 45
            004. | CC Sarah female 30
 
 
         -table:{<table_name_in_db>=<full_path_of_textfile>,*args}
                Provide table names and the full path of your text files.
 
         -int:{<column_name>,*args} 
                Name numeric columns here. Later it's easier to sort & filter.
                This parameter is optional.
 
         -append:<boolean>
                Supply 'true' or 'false' here. If you put 'true' records will
                be appended into existing table.
                This parameter is optional.
 
 
          Note: This tool is intended for CGI programmers doing lot of text
          based operation. Therefore may not fit for every case on earth ;)
 
 
  EXAMPLE
         dbci.rb company.db -table:{positions=/abc_company/position,employees=/abc_company/employees/} -int:{age,salary} -append:true
         Note: Do not put space between sub options!
